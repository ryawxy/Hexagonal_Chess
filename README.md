This is my project from a Basic Programming course, where I implemented Hexagonal Chess in Java. The main goal of the project was to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) and understand how to structure a game using classes and objects.

For more information about Hexagonal Chess, you can visit the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess)
